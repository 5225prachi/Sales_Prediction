# 📊 Sales Prediction System

### ✨ Overview

The **Sales Prediction System** is a Python-based application that uses machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on historical data extracted from Kaggle. By analyzing trends, seasonality, and other factors, the system provides sales forecasts and insights into future performance. The project also includes visualizations such as a pie chart, histogram, and scatter plot to enhance the analysis and help users understand the sales trends more clearly.

### 🚀 Features

- **📈 Sales Prediction:** Uses machine learning models to predict future sales based on historical data.
- **📊 Sales Analysis:** Provides detailed analysis of sales trends over time, helping to identify key patterns and factors influencing sales.
- **🔍 Visual Insights:** Includes a pie chart, histogram, and scatter plot to visualize the distribution of sales data and the predictions.
- **📅 Time-Based Forecasting:** Predicts future sales for different time periods (e.g., next month, quarter) to help in planning and strategy.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used to build the prediction system and handle data processing.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis of the Kaggle sales dataset.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for generating pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Implements machine learning algorithms for sales prediction.
- **Kaggle Dataset:** Provides the historical sales data for analysis and prediction.
